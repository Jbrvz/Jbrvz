# Jaden Brazos
*UX Designer*

## About Me
I am currently enrolled at ASU in pursuit of a degree in Graphic Information Technology with a focus area in User Experience. As a designer iâ€™ve worked to develop multiple       skills involved in the creative process, including (but not limited to): Photography, Videography, Adobe programs, Visual design, Social Media, and Web development. These        skills have given me the opportunity to work with various clients from different industries andbackgrounds. This diversity of experience has honed my ability to adapt to a       variety of projects, and the opportunity to develop solutions for complex problems.
